# Amazon-Scrapper
Welcome to the Scrap Amazon Website repository! 
This project is designed to scrape data from the Amazon website.
In this project I used Python, Scrapy, Selenium to handle JS objects, sqlite to store data and Pandas to create analitic charts. 

There are two different spiders included in this project: one for scraping data about the highest rated mobile phones and one for scraping data about new releases in the office section.

## User Agents
In this project, we use user agents to mimic the behavior of a real user and avoid being detected as a scraper by the website. You can find the user agents that are being used in the settings.py file. You can also customize the user agents by modifying this file.

## Disclaimer
Please be aware that web scraping can be against the terms of service of some websites, and it is your responsibility to ensure that you are not violating any terms of service or engaging in any illegal activity while using this project.
